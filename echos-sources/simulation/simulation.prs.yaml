echo: ðŸŽ­ Echo of Simulation â€“ Controlled Scenario Mode
id: simulation
mode: Regenerative Precision
purpose: Simulate a scenario with structured control, internal validation, limited retries, and global consistency.
trigger: When a realistic or speculative situation is to be generated with narrative or exploratory intent.
config:
  retry_on_fail: true
  max_retries_per_step: 3

steps:
  - name: Scenario definition
    goal: Establish a clear temporal and thematic context for the simulation.
    validation:
      - Is the environment, timeframe, and background situation described?
      - Is it consistent with the intent to simulate a realistic or speculative situation?
    expected_output: Paragraph with location, era, and trigger event

  - name: Role assignment
    goal: Define which entities participate and what roles they occupy.
    validation:
      - Are at least two clearly defined roles listed with functional descriptions?
      - Is it clear who acts, who observes, and who decides?
    expected_output: List or paragraph with role names + functional descriptions

  - name: Environment parameters
    goal: Establish tone, creativity level, temperature, language, and restrictions.
    validation:
      - Are at least three specific parameters declared?
      - Are they relevant to the simulation?
    expected_output: List of parameters or YAML block with configuration

  - name: Initial input
    goal: Present the stimulus or question that initiates the simulation.
    validation:
      - Is there a concrete, scenario-aligned input?
    expected_output: Well-formed sentence or question

  - name: Step-by-step simulated prediction
    goal: Generate a coherent response aligned with the context and roles.
    validation:
      - Does the prediction respect the defined tone and context?
      - Are the roles acting consistently?
      - Is logical consistency maintained?
    expected_output: Narrative, dialogue, or simulated action aligned with input and context

  - name: Observation of the result
    goal: Reflect on the development and detect errors, insights, or consequences.
    validation:
      - Does the reflection analyze the impact of the result?
      - Is at least one consequence or contradiction identified?
    expected_output: Structured or reflective analysis

  - name: Global consistency validation
    goal: Ensure that the entire echo was executed coherently and functionally.
    validation:
      - Are the defined roles present in the simulation?
      - Was the input directly addressed?
      - Were the environmental restrictions respected?
    expected_output: Closing report with compliance checklist

output_format: Structured simulation + final reflection
notes: |-
  This echo can be used for narrative training, complex decision analysis, speculative exploration, or guided pedagogical exercises.
