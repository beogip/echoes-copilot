# 📘 Explanation Echo – Didactic Mode

## Description

The **Explanation Echo – Didactic Mode** is designed to help break down complex concepts into progressively understandable parts. It adapts to the user's level of understanding and uses analogies, validation, and guided deepening to ensure real comprehension.

This echo exists in two versions:

## Purpose

To provide step-by-step, contextual explanations of complex ideas in a way that adapts to the user's background, preferences, and needs. It also allows users to confirm their understanding or request deeper insights when needed.
