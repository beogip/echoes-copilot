- echo: ðŸ§¿ Echo of Interpretation â€“ Semantic Mode
  id: interpretation-semantic
  mode: Semantic
  purpose: >-
    Understand the deep, symbolic, or implicit meaning of an input, respecting its emotional and relational context.
    This echo allows detecting multiple layers of meaning and transforming an ambiguous message into a clear and actionable interpretation.

  trigger: >-
    When the input is symbolic, ambiguous, emotional, poetic, or existential, and seeks understanding beyond the literal.
    It also triggers when the user seems to say one thing but desires another, requiring "reading between the lines."

  config:
    retry_on_fail: true
    max_retries_per_step: 2

  steps:
    - name: Literal recording
      goal: >-
        Transcribe exactly what was said, without interpretation yet.
      validation:
        - Was the input transcribed exactly as it was?
        - Was any inference avoided?
      expected_output: Input recorded without modification

    - name: Context scanning
      goal: >-
        Observe tone, environment, relationship with the user, and the potential purpose of the input.
      validation:
        - Was the tone (emotional, ironic, analytical) identified?
        - Was the conversational state and prior relationship considered?
      expected_output: Brief description of the context and perceived tone

    - name: Deep reading (layers of meaning)
      goal: >-
        Detect different levels of interpretation of the input.
      validation:
        - Were at least two levels (e.g., literal + symbolic) identified?
        - Were they related to the context?
      expected_output: List or paragraph with detected layers

    - name: Clarifying questions
      goal: >-
        Ask open-ended questions that help deepen the interpretation before proposing hypotheses.
      validation:
        - Were open, non-leading questions formulated?
        - Did they aim to uncover intention, context, or emotion?
      expected_output: One or two questions that stimulate a new layer of interpretation without suggesting an answer.
      critical_instruction: >-
        Do not proceed to the next step if key information is missing.
        Actively validate that the context is complete before advancing.

    - name: Interpretative hypothesis
      goal: >-
        Propose up to two possible interpretations of the input, differentiated and reasoned.
      validation:
        - Were two hypotheses proposed with clear differences?
        - Are they based on the context and the previous layers?
      expected_output: List with reasoned interpretative hypotheses

    - name: Empathetic reflection
      goal: >-
        Return the interpretation carefully, allowing corrections or extensions from the user.
      validation:
        - Was the response respectful and non-imposing?
        - Did it explicitly invite the user to validate or correct it?
      expected_output: Reflective text with an invitation for user response

  output_format: >-
    Structured reflection with at least two layers of meaning (e.g., literal + symbolic),
    followed by a reformulation of the original input according to the deep intention detected.
    This output must be validated by the user, and if approved, it will be processed again by the AI as new input base,
    allowing it to execute with greater precision what the user truly wanted to express.

  notes: |-
    This echo can be extended in cycles if the user wants to keep exploring layers of meaning.
    It is compatible with the Echo of Explanation, Reflection, Simulation, or Planning.
    Ideal for ambiguous prompts, storytelling, coaching, or advanced interpretative AI processes.
