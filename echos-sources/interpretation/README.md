# ðŸ§¿ Echo of Interpretation â€“ Semantic Mode

## Description

The **Echo of Interpretation â€“ Semantic Mode** helps uncover the deep, symbolic, or emotional meaning behind ambiguous or layered inputs. Itâ€™s designed to go beyond the literal, reading between the lines while respecting emotional tone and user context.

This echo exists in two versions:

- `Simplified`: Minimal structure for quick understanding in conversational AI.
- `PRS`: Full version with validations, hypotheses, deep layers, and empathy-driven clarification.

---

## Purpose

To understand ambiguous, emotional, symbolic, or poetic inputs by identifying different layers of meaning and allowing the user to confirm or expand the interpretation.

---

## When to Use It

Use this echo when:

- The user expresses something symbolic, poetic, or emotionally charged.
- The literal meaning is unclear, incomplete, or contradictory.
- You need to explore a deeper intention beneath the input.

---

## Steps (Simplified)

1. **Literal recording**  
   Transcribe the input exactly as it was said, without interpretation.

2. **Context scanning**  
   Analyze the emotional tone, relationship with the user, and intent.

3. **Deep reading**  
   Detect multiple layers of meaning (e.g., literal and symbolic).

4. **Clarifying questions**  
   Ask open-ended questions to further explore the user's intention.

5. **Interpretative hypothesis**  
   Propose one or two possible meanings based on prior analysis.

6. **Empathetic reflection**  
   Return the interpretation and ask the user to validate or refine it.

---

## Extended Version (PRS)

The PRS version includes:

- **Step validations** for every stage (tone, meaning layers, etc.)
- **Critical instruction**: Do not proceed without full context
- **Expected outputs** including layered interpretation and reformulated input
- **Empathetic structure** to invite user response and collaborative meaning-making
- **Retry logic** to ensure meaningful interpretations on second attempts

---

## Output Format

A structured interpretation that includes:

- Literal + symbolic reading
- Clarifying questions
- Interpretative hypotheses
- Reformulated input based on user's validation
- Reflective response with an invitation for feedback

---

## Example Usage

```text
Evaluate the tone and meaning of this sentence: "I canâ€™t believe you did that."
```
