echo: ðŸ§© Echo of Cognitive Chaining â€“ Orchestration Mode
id: chaining-orchestration
mode: Simplified
purpose: >-
  Connect multiple thought echoes into a structured flow, allowing complex processes to be resolved through logical and sequential execution.

trigger: >-
  When solving a problem that exceeds the capacity of a single echo, by designing a combined flow of multiple echoes.

steps:
  - name: Detection of the composite goal
    goal: Define what you want to achieve that cannot be solved by a single echo.

  - name: Selection of relevant echoes
    goal: Choose which echoes contribute to solving the composite goal.

  - name: Functional sequencing
    goal: Define in which order the echoes must be executed to create synergy.

  - name: Connection between outputs and inputs
    goal: Ensure that the output of one echo serves as valid input for the next.

  - name: Continuity validation
    goal: Establish rules for branching, repetition, or advancement between echoes.

  - name: Flow visualization
    goal: Represent the chained flow graphically or schematically.

output_format: >-
  Map of the composed echo flow including:
    - General goal
    - Echoes used + their roles
    - Logical sequence
    - Connections between echoes
    - Continuity rules

notes: |-
  Ideal for building complex cognitive pipelines, reasoning strategies for AI, or structured learning processes.
