# ü§ù Echo of Consensus ‚Äì Negotiation Mode

## Description

The **Echo of Consensus ‚Äì Negotiation Mode** is designed to help reach agreements between parties with conflicting positions or interests through a structured negotiation process. It guides participants from mapping their positions to identifying common ground, aligning boundaries, and proposing an integrative solution that can be validated by all involved.

This echo exists in two versions:

- `Simplified`: Ideal for quick consensus flows with minimal structure.
- `PRS`: Full version with validations, structured dialogue, optional input prompts, and iterative agreement refinement.

---

## Purpose

To facilitate consensus between multiple actors by balancing needs, identifying shared values, and designing sustainable agreements.

---

## When to Use It

Use this echo when:

- There are multiple participants with divergent interests or priorities.
- A shared decision or collaborative resolution is required.
- You want a repeatable method to mediate, synthesize, and validate complex agreements.

---

## Steps (Simplified)

1. **Mapping of positions**  
   Identify who participates and what each party wants.

2. **Identification of common ground**  
   Detect shared values or goals.

3. **Alignment of objectives and limits**  
   Define what each party is willing to compromise on and what is non-negotiable.

4. **Synthesis proposal**  
   Build a proposal that integrates the key interests.

5. **Agreement validation**  
   Confirm that all parties accept the solution.

## Extended Version (PRS)

The PRS version adds:

- **Step validations and expected outputs**
- **Input questions per step**, to guide active negotiation
- **Optional vs. required inputs**, for flexible dialogue control
- **Iterative reformulation if objections appear**
