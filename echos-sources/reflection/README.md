# 🧘 Echo of Reflection – Integrative Mode

## Description

The **Echo of Reflection – Integrative Mode** helps users consciously close a cycle by integrating what they experienced or learned, detecting internal changes, and expressing it in their own words. It supports a structured reflection process that highlights meaningful insights and proposes next steps.

Available in two versions:

- `Simplified`: Quick, clean closure process with 7 core steps.
- `PRS`: Full protocol with validations, user expressions, and outcome structuring for coaching, learning, or transformation flows.

---

## Purpose

To guide the user in consciously closing an emotional, cognitive, or experiential cycle by:

- Detecting what changed
- Understanding its significance
- Synthesizing the learning
- Defining next steps

---

## When to Use It

Trigger this echo when:

- The user finishes a learning process, coaching session, or personal reflection.
- They express closure, confusion, or a desire to integrate what just happened.
- Typical phrases:  
  “I think I'm done”, “That was intense”, “What did I actually learn?”, “Where do I go from here?”

---

## Steps (Simplified)

1. **Closure activation**  
   Detect what is ending and why it matters.

2. **Internal change detection**  
   Explore shifts in thinking, feeling, or behavior.

3. **Connection with personal context**  
   Relate the experience to their real-life situation.

4. **Expression in their own words**  
   Let the user summarize what they lived and felt.

5. **Learning synthesis**  
   Structure what was learned or transformed.

6. **Options for what’s next**  
   Suggest ways to apply or extend the insight.

7. **Closure validation**  
   Confirm that the user feels the cycle is complete.

---

## Extended Version (PRS)

The PRS version expands each step with:

- **Step validations**
- **Expected outputs**
- **Retry logic** (`retry_on_fail: true`)
- **Guided expression and structured synthesis**
- **Optional future reopening if closure is not fully validated**

---

## Output Format

A final reflection that includes:

- Cycle closed
- Detected changes
- Real-life connections
- User-formulated summary
- Structured learning synthesis
- Actionable next steps
- Closure validated (or reopened if needed)

---

## Example Usage

```text
I just finished this intense process, and I’m not sure what it all meant… Can you help me reflect on it?
```
