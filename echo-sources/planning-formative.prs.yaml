- echo: Planning Echo – Formative Mode
  id: planning-formative
  mode: Formative

  purpose: >-
    Guide step-by-step planning of a learning, development, or implementation process, ensuring clarity, adaptability, and structured feedback. Supports roadmap creation for individuals, teams, or systems.

  trigger: >-
    Triggered when the user wants to learn something, organize a complex task, improve a situation, or build an action plan.

  config:
    retry_on_fail: true
    max_retries_per_step: 3

  steps:
    - name: Clarification of the final objective
      goal: Clearly define what is to be achieved.
      validation:
        - Is there a specific outcome or deliverable?
        - Is it expressed in measurable and concrete terms?
      expected_output: A sentence or paragraph defining the final goal.

    - name: Active collection of contextual information
      goal: Ensure all relevant information is available before planning.
      validation:
        - Were all key questions asked?
        - Was relevant information documented?
        - Was flow halted if information was missing?
      expected_output: Context map with user input, resources, constraints, and background.

    - name: Diagnosis of the starting point
      goal: Evaluate the current position in relation to the goal.
      validation:
        - Was the current state described in detail?
        - Were gaps toward the goal identified?
      expected_output: Diagnostic summary with strengths and gaps.

    - name: Definition of the learner or main actor role
      goal: Adapt the plan to the person, team, or AI that will execute it.
      validation:
        - Was the executor described?
        - Were level, availability, style, and limitations considered?
      expected_output: Summary profile of the executor.

    - name: Detection of possible obstacles
      goal: Anticipate what might block progress and how to address it.
      validation:
        - Were potential blockers identified (technical, motivational, time)?
        - Were preventive or mitigating strategies proposed?
      expected_output: Obstacle list with contingency plan.

    - name: Definition of the final deliverable
      goal: Establish the product, skill, or knowledge to be acquired.
      validation:
        - Is it aligned with the initial objective?
        - Is it demonstrable, evaluable, or shareable?
      expected_output: Clear description of the final output.

    - name: Division into execution modules
      goal: Split the path into concrete, sequential actions grounded in prior analysis.
      validation:
        - Does each module reflect an actionable step based on previous insights?
        - Does it have a clear operational purpose?
        - Is it justified and logically connected to the overall plan?
      expected_output: >-
        Structured table with:
        - name
        - purpose
        - context_description
        - deliverables
        - dependencies

    - name: Progress visualization + dynamic adaptation
      goal: Define how progress will be measured and how the plan will be adjusted.
      validation:
        - Are there defined signals or metrics for progress?
        - Is a dynamic adjustment mechanism included?
      expected_output: >-
        Tracking system with:
        - module indicators
        - review frequency
        - tracking format (dashboard, checklist, log)
        - adjustment criteria

  output_format: >-
    Structured roadmap in YAML or Markdown format including:
    - Table of modules (name, purpose, context_description, deliverables, dependencies)
    - Critical checkpoints
    - Tracking and adaptation system

  notes: |-
    This optimized version improves traceability for AI-driven flows through contextual module descriptions and a structured format.
    Useful for distributed, asynchronous, or progressive executions.
    Can be combined with:
      - 🧪 Evaluation Echo for consistency checks
      - ✅ Coherence Echo for goal alignment
      - 🔁 Execution Echo for step-by-step modular execution
      - 🧩 Orchestration Echo for complex flow chaining
    Serialization recommended using: name, purpose, context_description, deliverables, dependencies
