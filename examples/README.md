# Examples Directory

This directory contains practical examples of how to use Echo Protocol patterns with GitHub Copilot in different programming languages and contexts.

## Structure

### `/javascript/`

Examples using JavaScript/Node.js including:

- Authentication and authorization systems
- Rate limiting implementation
- Caching strategies
- Error handling patterns

### `/python/`

Examples using Python including:

- Database management and optimization
- Data processing pipelines
- Async programming patterns
- Job queue systems

### `/typescript/`

Examples using TypeScript/React including:

- Component optimization
- Custom hooks
- State management
- Performance analysis
- Form handling

## How to Use Examples

1. **Copy the example files** to your project
2. **Modify the ECHO comments** to match your specific problems
3. **Let Copilot analyze** using the structured reasoning patterns
4. **Apply the recommendations** generated by the echo processes

## Echo Comment Patterns

Each example demonstrates how to use echo comments effectively:

```javascript
// ECHO: diagnostic
// Clear description of the problem to analyze

// ECHO: planning
// Description of what needs to be implemented

// ECHO: evaluation
// Request for code review or assessment

// ECHO: optimization
// Code that needs performance or structure improvements

// ECHO: coherence
// Code with consistency issues to resolve

// ECHO: prioritization
// Multiple options that need ranking/ordering
```

## Contributing Examples

When adding new examples:

1. Include multiple echo types in realistic scenarios
2. Use clear, descriptive echo comments
3. Show both problems and solutions when possible
4. Cover different complexity levels
5. Include relevant technology stacks

Examples should demonstrate real-world development challenges where structured reasoning provides clear value.
