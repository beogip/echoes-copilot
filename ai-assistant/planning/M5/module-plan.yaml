  context_summary: |
    Ensure that all documentation components work together to create a coherent and complete user experience.

    Alignment objectives:
    ✅ User Journey Coherence: From discovery → setup → usage → mastery
    ✅ Technical Coherence: Instructions match real system behavior
    ✅ Content Coherence: Consistent terminology, style and depth
    ✅ Platform Coherence: Works across different skill levels and use cases

    Gap analysis by user phase:
    - Discovery Phase: ✅ Strong (clear description, compelling value proposition)
    - Setup Phase: ⚠️ Moderate (basic instructions exist, missing quick start guide)
    - Usage Phase: ⚠️ Moderate (trigger patterns documented, missing language-specific guides)
    - Mastery Phase: ❌ Weak (customization, advanced troubleshooting, best practices missing)

    Status: Pending M3 (installers) and M4 (testing).

    Future coherence principles: single responsibility, progressive disclosure, clear cross-references, content validation.
