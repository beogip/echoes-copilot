  context_summary: |
    Comprehensive validation of Echo Protocol quality and functionality.

    Quality criteria:
    1. Functional correctness: Echo triggers work as expected
    2. Response quality: Copilot generates structured and useful responses
    3. Consistency: Reproducible results in different contexts
    4. Performance: Response time and system resource usage
    5. Usability: Developer experience and learning curve

    Minimum viable quality standards:
    ✅ Echo Recognition: >90% trigger recognition rate
    ✅ Structure Compliance: >80% responses follow echo format
    ✅ Technical Accuracy: >90% recommendations are correct
    ✅ User Satisfaction: >75% developers find it useful
    ✅ Performance: <3s average response time

    Status: Pending M2 (ready-to-use file).

    Testing scope: trigger recognition, response generation, cross-language compatibility, integration, performance.
