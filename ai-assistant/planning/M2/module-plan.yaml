  context_summary: |
    Create a single, self-contained .github/copilot-instructions.md file that any developer can copy to their project and immediately use Echo Protocol with GitHub Copilot.

    Critical objectives:
    - Size < 100KB (Copilot limitations)
    - Contains the 6 development echos (functional definitions)
    - Valid Markdown syntax for Copilot parsing
    - Includes usage examples and best practices
    - No external dependencies

    Status: Pending completion of M1 (build system).

    Identified obstacles: size restrictions, format compatibility, quality of auto-generated content.
