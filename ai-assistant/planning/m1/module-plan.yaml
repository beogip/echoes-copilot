      type: "completed"
      summary: "M1.2 completed: Enhanced build.js with Winston logging, comprehensive error handling, build validation, performance monitoring, and graceful fallback mechanisms. Build system now processes 6 echo files with 0 errors and 0 warnings, achieving 16ms build time with 24,402 characters output."

      type: "completed"
      summary: "M1.3 completed: Comprehensive test suite implementation with 189 automated tests (154 BATS integration tests + 35 Jest tests). Applied Echo Protocol diagnostic and prioritization methodologies to systematically resolve complex test failures, achieving 100% test pass rate across all test suites. Fixed critical installer script bugs and enhanced security testing."

  context_summary: |
    Critical module for the progress of M2-M6. Fix the build system which presents YAML parsing errors.

    Identified problems:
    - Build system (build/build.js) with YAML parsing errors, especially PRS files
    - Duplicate keys and formatting/indentation issues
    - Build generates warnings but does not stop execution on errors
    - Incomplete output (missing echos in copilot-instructions.md)
    - No robust YAML file validation or detailed reporting
    - No automated tests to validate build behavior

    Defined modular plan:
    M1.1: Clean and correct PRS files with duplicate keys or invalid format
    M1.2: Improve error handling, validation, and reporting in build.js
    M1.3: Create automated tests to validate build against edge cases
    M1.4: Add post-build checks to ensure validity of generated files
    M1.5: Document build flow, validation, and troubleshooting

    Status: In progress - M1.1 started.

    Critical dependencies: M2-M6 depend on the robustness and completeness of the build system.
