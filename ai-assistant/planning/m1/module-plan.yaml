  context_summary: |
    Critical module for the progress of M2-M6. Fix the build system which presents YAML parsing errors.

    Identified problems:
    - Build system (build/build.js) with YAML parsing errors, especially PRS files
    - Duplicate keys and formatting/indentation issues
    - Build generates warnings but does not stop execution on errors
    - Incomplete output (missing echos in copilot-instructions.md)
    - No robust YAML file validation or detailed reporting
    - No automated tests to validate build behavior

    Defined modular plan:
    M1.1: Clean and correct PRS files with duplicate keys or invalid format
    M1.2: Improve error handling, validation, and reporting in build.js
    M1.3: Create automated tests to validate build against edge cases
    M1.4: Add post-build checks to ensure validity of generated files
    M1.5: Document build flow, validation, and troubleshooting

    Status: In progress - M1.1 started.

    Critical dependencies: M2-M6 depend on the robustness and completeness of the build system.
