submodule:
  id: M1.3
  name: "Build tests"
  status: "completed"
  context_summary: |
    Comprehensive test suite implementation for the enhanced build system, including critical installer script testing and CI/CD integration. Successfully created and fixed 189 automated tests covering YAML validation, edge cases, integration testing, performance validation, and cross-platform installer compatibility. Applied diagnostic and prioritization echo protocols to systematically resolve complex test failures, achieving 100% test pass rate across BATS and Jest test suites.
  deliverables:
    - "✅ Comprehensive Jest test suite (35 tests) covering YAML validation, malformed files, edge cases, performance, and regression scenarios"
    - "✅ Extensive BATS integration test suite (154 tests) for cross-platform installer compatibility and security validation"
    - "✅ Fixed critical installer script bugs: relative path resolution, variable references, and cross-platform compatibility issues"
    - "✅ Enhanced security testing with malicious input detection and command injection prevention"
    - "✅ Performance benchmarking with stress tests (50x iterations, 100-file batches, parallel builds)"
    - "✅ Applied Echo Protocol methodology (diagnostic + prioritization echos) for systematic problem resolution"
    - "✅ Automated test execution integrated with npm test script and comprehensive error reporting"
  next_step: "M1.3 completed successfully. Ready to proceed with M1.4: Output validation."
