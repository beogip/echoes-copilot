# ai-assistant-translate

**Objective:** Translate all current documentation (YAML, Markdown, and planning files) to English, module by module, to ensure accessibility and clarity for international contributors.

## Workflow

- Each module (M1, M2, etc.) will have its documentation translated and tracked as a submodule.
- Progress and deliverables are tracked in `module-plan.yaml` and `modules-index.yaml`.
- Translations should preserve technical accuracy and context.

## Next Steps

- Start with M1 documentation translation.
- Update planning files as each module is completed.
