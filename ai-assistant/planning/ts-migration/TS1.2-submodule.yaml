  deliverables:
    - Main scripts in TypeScript
    - Basic typing applied
  completion_criteria:
    - Scripts compile and work as before
    - No regressions introduced
  constraints:
    - Maintain original logic and functionality
    - Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies
    - Keep folder structure and names
  notes:
    - Document any relevant typing decision in ai-assistant/context/development-context.md
