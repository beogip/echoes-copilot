submodule:
  id: TS1.3
  name: "Utilities and Helpers Migration"
  objective: |
    Migrate shared utilities and helpers to TypeScript, improving clarity and type safety.
  scope: |
    - Rename and migrate utilities to .ts
    - Add types and refactor imports/exports
  deliverables:
    - Utilities in TypeScript
  completion_criteria:
    - Utilities compile and pass basic tests
  constraints:
    - Preserve original utility logic
    - Avoid unnecessary complexity
  notes:
    - Document any relevant typing or refactor decision in ai-assistant/context/development-context.md
    - Validate utilities with basic test cases
    - Run regression or behavioral tests after migration and record results in ai-assistant/context/development-context.md for traceability

      summary: "Detailed plan for submodule TS1.3 created for utilities and helpers migration to TypeScript."
    - date: "2025-06-06"
      type: "completed"
      summary: |
        TS1.3.1 completed: All main utilities and helpers in /scripts/build/ are already migrated to .ts (echo-merge, metrics, index, logger, utils, error-handler, file-ops, yaml-loader, validation). Missing migration of validate-prs-yaml.js, which will be included in the next TS1.3 stage.

      type: "completed"
      summary: |
        TS1.3.2 completed: validate-prs-yaml.js migrated to TypeScript as validate-prs-yaml.ts, with support for individual file and directory validation. All echo YAMLs normalized to root object and validated with the new validator. Documentation and README updated with usage instructions.
    - date: "2025-06-07"
      type: "completed"
      summary: |
        TS1.3.3 completed: All functions, arguments, and return values in /scripts/build/*.ts have explicit type annotations. Replaced 'any' with more precise types where possible, keeping 'any' only in catch blocks. Build and scripts were successfully validated with tsc and ts-node. Planning and context updated.
