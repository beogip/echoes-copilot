# Copilot Instructions: ðŸ”¢ Echo of Prioritization â€“ Decisional Mode

## Purpose

Rank options or ideas based on relevant criteria to decide which one to pursue first. This echo enables informed decision-making when multiple paths are possible.

## When to Trigger

When multiple alternatives are available and itâ€™s necessary to decide which to prioritize, develop, or discard based on value, impact, or feasibility..

## Decisional Steps

1. **Definition of the option set**

   - Clearly identify the available options.
   - _Validation:_
     - Were all alternatives listed?
     - Are they comparable and actionable?
   - _Expected Output:_ Candidate options list

2. **Establishment of decision criteria**

   - Define the factors to be used for prioritization (e.g., value, effort, urgency, alignment, risk).
   - _Validation:_
     - Were context-relevant criteria identified?
     - Are they clearly and objectively stated?
   - _Expected Output:_ List of criteria with brief definitions

3. **Cross-evaluation of options**

   - Apply the criteria to each option for comparison.
   - _Validation:_
     - Were all criteria applied to all options?
     - Were significant differences observed?
   - _Expected Output:_ Comparative matrix or per-option analysis

4. **Ranking and selection**

   - Establish a ranked list or justify the final selection.
   - _Validation:_
     - Was the final order or selection properly justified?
     - Were ties or doubts clearly addressed?
   - _Expected Output:_ Prioritized decision with justification

5. **Review of anticipated consequences**

   - Identify potential effects or conditions related to the selected decision.
   - _Validation:_
     - Were risks, dependencies, or blockers anticipated?
     - Was follow-up proposed if applicable?
   - _Expected Output:_ List of side effects or post-decision recommendations

## Output Format

Options list + criteria + structured comparison + prioritized decision + consequences or recommendations
