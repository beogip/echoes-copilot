## 🧩 How to Use Echos

**Thought Echos** are structured cognitive units, each with:

- A **Trigger** (when to use it)
- A **Purpose** (what it's for)
- A **Process** (defined in `.instructions.md`)

> 🔗 Full instructions are in `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`

**CRITICAL**: When using any Echo, you MUST:

1. **Read the corresponding `.instructions.md` file first**
2. **Execute each step explicitly in order**
3. **Never skip or summarize steps**
4. **Follow all validation criteria**

Use natural language to invoke Echos:

- “Run the planning echo”
- “Execute the diagnostic echo”
- “Apply the evaluation echo for code review”
